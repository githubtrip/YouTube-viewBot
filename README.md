# YouTube-viewBot
Bot that generates views on a YouTube video(s) of choice.

### Prerequisites
* Windows Operating System
   - viewBot calls commands that are configured for Windows
   - If you machine does not have Windows as its native OS, it is recommended that you set up a virtual Windows system using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* NordVPN
   - viewBot utilizes a rotating proxy through the help of NordVPN
   - You can either purchase a NordVPN subscription or set up a trial at the [NordVPN website](https://nordvpn.com/?utm_expid=.CM-bHTe9S0iFcch8gLNeEA.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)
   - Without NordVPN, the viewBot will be unable to use the commands located within the '/src/proxy_list.txt' file and it is likely that YouTube will detect an unusually high traffic volume coming from the IP address your machine is using
